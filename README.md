# coin_interview_app
A frontend application I'm building for a take home interview. This SPA displays information for multiple cryptocurrencies.

## install instructions
From a command line or terminal window:
1. type `git clone https://github.com/zfreedman/coin_interview_app.git` to clone the git repository
2. type `cd coin_interview_app` to navigate into the root directory
3. type `npm install` to install the npm dependencies (these are boilerplate packages used by the create-react-app npm module)
4. type `npm run start` to spinup the SPA at localhost:3000
5. (OPTIONAL) type `npm run test` in a second terminal window to run tests
